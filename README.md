# microservices-workspace
Example local setup for developing heterogeneous microservices.

In this setup we show:

1. A microservcie written in Go and set up with code hot-reloading for
   comfortable development. 
2. A microservice written in Node and similarly set up with code hot-reloading
3. A Kong-based API gateway wiring microservices to various routes so that the
   clients don't need to know about and hardcode their calls against multiple
   ports the microservices actualy serve from. Kong saves its state in a
   Postgres database.
4. Resilient set-up of database that a microservice can use (MySQL for the sake
   of the demo). Database setup uses Docker volumes and survives container
   restarts/crashes.
5. Each microservice is checked into their own Git repository. This main
   repository you are currently viewing simply orchestrates creation of a single
   "workspace" point, from which all developers can grab the entire project and
   easily build it.

This approach allows developers to easily switch between working on just a
specific microservice and a larger "project space".

As systems get large you may want to have more than one project space. That is a
decision you would take based on your unique needs. However, this blueprint
workspace provides a lot of recipes to get you on the journey of breaking-up and
composing work as you see fit and creating an enjoyable, yet simple development
workspace.

## Prerequisites:

A working Docker setup, which you can get pretty easily for most major platforms
like Mac, Windows and Linux flavors:
<https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download> 

## Installing

To run the entire project with all microservices and databases:

```
> git clone https://github.com/inadarei/microservices-workspace.git && cd microservices-workspace

# Bring everything up in daemon mode. 
> make

# Make sure everything started fine:
> make ps

# Register individual microservices with the API Gateway (Kong):
> make register_all
```

To tear-down the project:

```
> make stop
```

## Using

1. Once everything is properly installed various microservices can be
   accessed with sub-routes of the API Gateway's URI. In the out-of-the-box
   installation, you get two microservices respectively at:

   ```
   > curl http://0.0.0.0:9080/demogo
   # and
   > curl http://0.0.0.0:9080/demonode
   ```

   If you want Kong to run on a port different from 8000, you can change
   the value in dockor-compose.yml, for instance to make it run on port 80:

   ```
   ports:
     - "80:80"
   ```

## Service Discovery â€“ Traefik

**Q:** How are microservices discovered by the front-end proxy?

**A:** The workspace uses a modern, highly capable proxy:
[Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) which automatically discovers services in
your project and wires them up to the proper sub-routes.

Once you have the project up, you can access the web UI of the proxy at:
http://0.0.0.0:9880/

## How to add more microservices:

- Edit config/repos.json
- Run `make update` in the topmost repository to get the new codebase
- Edit start.sh and stop.sh scripts under ./bin to add start and stop
  commands for the new module. Existing commands should be used as a guide.
- Make sure the docker-compose file for the service has labels required
  by Traefik 
  
  example: <https://github.com/inadarei/microservices-workspace-ms-demo-node/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L6>)
- Make sure the docker-compose commands are starting your new service
  in the same project as the Traefik and the rest of the services
